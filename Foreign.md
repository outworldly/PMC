# Mercenaries and Military Services Abroad

## Introduction
In the supply and military services abroad, there is a wide range of people and companies involved. Some are respectable and legitimate, while others are not.

## Types of Individuals and Companies Involved
- Mercenaries: These are "soldiers of fortune" who are willing to fight for any cause or power that pays them. They can be misguided adventurers or disreputable thugs.
- Volunteers: These individuals are excluded from the Geneva Convention definition of mercenaries if their motives are idealistic rather than financial. However, it can be difficult to distinguish volunteers from traditional mercenaries. For example, Islamic militants in Afghanistan, Chechnya, or the Balkans may be considered volunteers, but they are often paid and money may be as much a part of their motivation as ideology.
- Servicemen enlisted in foreign armies: Some governments recruit individuals to serve in foreign armies. The Gurkhas in the British and Indian armies are a legitimate example of such forces.

## Involvement of the White Legion
During President Mobutu's last days in power, he employed the so-called 'White Legion.' This group was involved in the supply and military services abroad.

## Spectrum of Involvement
In practice, a wide spectrum of people and companies can be involved in the supply or military services abroad. This includes both respectable and legitimate entities, as well as disreputable ones.

## Summary
- Mercenaries, volunteers, and servicemen enlisted in foreign armies can be involved in the supply and military services abroad.
- The distinction between volunteers and traditional mercenaries can be challenging, as volunteers may also be motivated by financial gain.
- The White Legion was employed by President Mobutu during his last days in power.
- The involvement of people and companies in the supply or military services abroad can vary greatly in terms of legitimacy and reputation. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are companies that provide a range of different services, including combat forces. However, the number of PMCs that engage in combat operations is limited and relatively rare.

## Defence Industrial Companies
- Many defence industrial companies not only supply equipment but also provide training and maintenance packages.
- These companies may also arrange to supply personnel to operate the equipment, such as pilots to fly aircraft.
- In some cases, the services provided by defence industrial companies may not be very different from those provided by PMCs.

## Examples of PMCs
- Executive Outcomes (EO) is a PMC that has conducted operations involving combat. Two of their operations are described in boxes 1 and 2.
- However, it is important to note that such combat operations by PMCs are not very common.

# Main Differences between PMCs and Defence Industrial Companies
- PMCs primarily focus on providing military services, including combat forces, while defence industrial companies mainly supply equipment.
- PMCs may provide a wider range of services beyond combat, such as logistics, training, and security.
- Defence industrial companies often export equipment under license, while PMCs may provide personnel to operate the equipment.

# Similarities between PMCs and Defence Industrial Companies
- Both PMCs and defence industrial companies may provide training and maintenance packages along with the equipment they supply.
- In some cases, the services provided by defence industrial companies may overlap with those provided by PMCs.

# Examples of Services Provided by PMCs
- Combat forces: Some PMCs may provide forces for combat operations, although this is relatively rare.
- Logistics: PMCs may offer logistical support, such as transportation and supply chain management.
- Training: PMCs may provide training services to military personnel or security forces.
- Security: PMCs may offer security services, including protecting individuals, facilities, or convoys.

# Conclusion
Private Military Companies (PMCs) and defence industrial companies have some similarities in the services they provide, such as training and maintenance packages. However, PMCs primarily focus on military services, including combat forces, while defence industrial companies mainly supply equipment. PMCs may also offer a wider range of services beyond combat, such as logistics, training, and security.

## Services Provided by PMCs
PMCs offer a range of services, including:

1. Advice:
   - PMCs can provide advice on various military matters, such as restructuring armed forces or operational planning.
   - Examples include advising on the purchase of equipment or providing guidance on military strategies.

2. Training:
   - Training is a major activity of PMCs.
   - Some training may be linked to combat, such as training soldiers in Angola and Sierra Leone.
   - Training can also be independent and focused on specific skills or tasks.
   - For example, a UK company called Watchgnar trained forces in the Middle East, including personal bodyguards of rulers.
   - Another example is the US company Vinnell, which reportedly trains the Saudi Palace guard.

3. Logistic Support:
   - PMCs also provide logistic support to military operations.
   - Logistic support can involve various tasks, such as delivering humanitarian aid or providing supplies and equipment.
   - For instance, the company MPRI assisted the US Government in delivering humanitarian aid in the former Soviet Union.
   - Dyncorp and Pacific A&E provided logistic support for the UN force in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).
   - Brown and Root is known for providing US forces in the Balkans with a wide range of support, including water purification and repatriation of bodies.

4. Supply of Personnel:
   - PMCs can also supply personnel to support military operations.
   - This can include hiring and deploying individuals with military expertise or specialized skills.
   - Examples of personnel provided by PMCs include security personnel, military advisors, or technical experts.

It is important to note that PMCs operate as private entities and are not part of any government's official military forces. They are hired by governments or organizations to supplement or support existing military capabilities. 

# Private Military Companies (PMCs) and Private Security Companies (PSCs)

### International Operations
When PSCs provide services overseas, they typically do so through a local subsidiary that operates under the laws and regulations of the host country. This allows them to comply with local requirements and ensure their operations are in line with local laws.

## Comparison between PMCs and PSCs
- PMCs primarily serve the US Government, while PSCs offer services to a variety of clients, including companies, governments, and organizations.
- PMCs focus on logistics, equipment testing, training, and strategic advice, while PSCs specialize in providing security services.
- PMCs' international operations are usually a small part of their business, while PSCs often operate extensively abroad.
- PSCs may be required by governments in some countries for foreign investors to provide their own security, while PMCs primarily serve the US Government's needs.

## PSCs and their activities
- PSCs offer security services, such as guarding and protecting individuals, buildings, or assets.
- Some PSCs operate in dangerous areas and employ armed guards who may be difficult to distinguish from soldiers.
- PSCs can also be involved in training local forces, negotiating with rebel groups, and using advanced intelligence equipment.
- An extreme example of the merging roles between PSCs and PMCs is the case of Gurkha Security Guards in Sierra Leone. Initially a security services company, they later accepted an invitation to train the Sierra Leone armed forces. During their work, some members of the team were ambushed by rebel forces, engaged in combat, and unfortunately lost their lives.

## PMCs and their activities
- PMCs engage in a wider range of activities compared to PSCs, including combat operations.
- They can provide military training, strategic advice, and logistical support to armed forces.
- PMCs may also participate in peacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief efforts.
- Some PMCs have been involved in controversial activities, such as providing security for fisheries or training for military operations.

## Definitions and Challenges

- The internationally agreed definitions of PMCs and mercenaries have been shaped to suit the agendas of those drafting them, and may not be very useful.
- Different labels can be devised based on the activities, intentions, and effects of these operators.
- In practice, the categories of PMCs and mercenaries often merge into one another.
- If the government decides to regulate this activity, choosing the right definitions will be a significant challenge.

## Lack of Information

- Information about private military activity abroad is hard to obtain and often unreliable.
- Different sources may have different perspectives on the same activity.
- This lack of reliable information makes it challenging to accurately assess the extent of private military company and mercenary activity.

## Coup Attempts involving Mercenaries (1970-1995)
- Guinea
- Equatorial Guinea
- Benin
- Togo
- Comoros Islands (four times)
- Seychelle Islands
- Dominica
- Haiti
- Ghana
- Suriname
- Maldives

# Examples of Mercenary/PMC Interventions in Africa since the 1950s

1. Biafra Conflict:
   - Mercenaries involved were described as "little more than thugs in uniform" by Frederick Forsyth.
   - Their impact on the conflict may have been minimal.

2. Afghanistan:
   - The largest scale intervention by non-nationals.
   - Forces fighting against the Russians and other Afghan groups included major foreign elements.
   - More than half of the Taliban forces were estimated to be from outside Afghanistan.
   - Financial rewards likely played a significant role in attracting these individuals.

# Mercenaries and their Role in Conflict

## Impact of Mercenaries in Conflict
- Mercenaries can have a significant impact on the outcome of a conflict, especially when they possess specialized skills or have access to advanced equipment.
- In some cases, a small number of mercenaries can make a large difference in the outcome of a battle or war.
- Foreign mercenaries have been known to fly fighter-bombers for national air forces, providing critical capabilities to the government they are fighting for.
- Sierra Leone and Guinea have employed foreign mercenaries with specialist military skills to help restore security in the region.
