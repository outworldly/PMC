# Mercenaries and Military Services Abroad

## Introduction
In the supply and military services abroad, there is a wide range of people and companies involved. Some are respectable and legitimate, while others are not.

## Types of Individuals and Companies Involved
- Mercenaries: These are "soldiers of fortune" who are willing to fight for any cause or power that pays them. They can be misguided adventurers or disreputable thugs.
- Volunteers: These individuals are excluded from the Geneva Convention definition of mercenaries if their motives are idealistic rather than financial. However, it can be difficult to distinguish volunteers from traditional mercenaries. For example, Islamic militants in Afghanistan, Chechnya, or the Balkans may be considered volunteers, but they are often paid and money may be as much a part of their motivation as ideology.
- Servicemen enlisted in foreign armies: Some governments recruit individuals to serve in foreign armies. The Gurkhas in the British and Indian armies are a legitimate example of such forces.

## Involvement of the White Legion
During President Mobutu's last days in power, he employed the so-called 'White Legion.' This group was involved in the supply and military services abroad.

## Spectrum of Involvement
In practice, a wide spectrum of people and companies can be involved in the supply or military services abroad. This includes both respectable and legitimate entities, as well as disreputable ones.

## Summary
- Mercenaries, volunteers, and servicemen enlisted in foreign armies can be involved in the supply and military services abroad.
- The distinction between volunteers and traditional mercenaries can be challenging, as volunteers may also be motivated by financial gain.
- The White Legion was employed by President Mobutu during his last days in power.
- The involvement of people and companies in the supply or military services abroad can vary greatly in terms of legitimacy and reputation. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are companies that provide a range of different services, including combat forces. However, the number of PMCs that engage in combat operations is limited and relatively rare.

## Defence Industrial Companies
- Many defence industrial companies not only supply equipment but also provide training and maintenance packages.
- These companies may also arrange to supply personnel to operate the equipment, such as pilots to fly aircraft.
- In some cases, the services provided by defence industrial companies may not be very different from those provided by PMCs.

## Examples of PMCs
- Executive Outcomes (EO) is a PMC that has conducted operations involving combat. Two of their operations are described in boxes 1 and 2.
- However, it is important to note that such combat operations by PMCs are not very common.

# Main Differences between PMCs and Defence Industrial Companies
- PMCs primarily focus on providing military services, including combat forces, while defence industrial companies mainly supply equipment.
- PMCs may provide a wider range of services beyond combat, such as logistics, training, and security.
- Defence industrial companies often export equipment under license, while PMCs may provide personnel to operate the equipment.

# Similarities between PMCs and Defence Industrial Companies
- Both PMCs and defence industrial companies may provide training and maintenance packages along with the equipment they supply.
- In some cases, the services provided by defence industrial companies may overlap with those provided by PMCs.

# Examples of Services Provided by PMCs
- Combat forces: Some PMCs may provide forces for combat operations, although this is relatively rare.
- Logistics: PMCs may offer logistical support, such as transportation and supply chain management.
- Training: PMCs may provide training services to military personnel or security forces.
- Security: PMCs may offer security services, including protecting individuals, facilities, or convoys.

# Conclusion
Private Military Companies (PMCs) and defence industrial companies have some similarities in the services they provide, such as training and maintenance packages. However, PMCs primarily focus on military services, including combat forces, while defence industrial companies mainly supply equipment. PMCs may also offer a wider range of services beyond combat, such as logistics, training, and security. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military-related services to governments, organizations, or individuals. These services can include advice, training, and logistic support.

## Services Provided by PMCs
PMCs offer a range of services, including:

1. Advice:
   - PMCs can provide advice on various military matters, such as restructuring armed forces or operational planning.
   - Examples include advising on the purchase of equipment or providing guidance on military strategies.

2. Training:
   - Training is a major activity of PMCs.
   - Some training may be linked to combat, such as training soldiers in Angola and Sierra Leone.
   - Training can also be independent and focused on specific skills or tasks.
   - For example, a UK company called Watchgnar trained forces in the Middle East, including personal bodyguards of rulers.
   - Another example is the US company Vinnell, which reportedly trains the Saudi Palace guard.

3. Logistic Support:
   - PMCs also provide logistic support to military operations.
   - Logistic support can involve various tasks, such as delivering humanitarian aid or providing supplies and equipment.
   - For instance, the company MPRI assisted the US Government in delivering humanitarian aid in the former Soviet Union.
   - Dyncorp and Pacific A&E provided logistic support for the UN force in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).
   - Brown and Root is known for providing US forces in the Balkans with a wide range of support, including water purification and repatriation of bodies.

4. Supply of Personnel:
   - PMCs can also supply personnel to support military operations.
   - This can include hiring and deploying individuals with military expertise or specialized skills.
   - Examples of personnel provided by PMCs include security personnel, military advisors, or technical experts.

It is important to note that PMCs operate as private entities and are not part of any government's official military forces. They are hired by governments or organizations to supplement or support existing military capabilities. 

# Private Military Companies (PMCs)

Private Military Companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military services to governments, organizations, or individuals. They play various roles in monitoring operations, demining, combat operations, and non-combat operations.

## Monitoring Roles
- DynCorp and Pacific A&E are two PMCs that have recruited and managed United States' contributions to monitoring operations in the Balkans.
- Monitoring operations involve overseeing and ensuring compliance with agreements or regulations in a specific area or conflict zone.

## Demining
- Demining is the process of removing landmines and other explosive devices from an area.
- Specialist companies like Minetech from South Africa are involved in demining operations.
- Some PMCs, like Saracen's EO offshoot, include demining as part of a wider security package in countries like Angola.

## Combat and Non-Combat Operations
- The distinction between combat and non-combat operations can be artificial.
- Those involved in combat operations directly engage in fighting, while those in non-combat operations support the military effort in various ways.
- Examples of non-combat roles include flying soldiers and equipment to the battlefield, maintenance, training, intelligence, planning, and organization.
- Each of these roles contributes to the overall war fighting capability.
- The level of involvement in active military operations may vary depending on the broader strategic picture.
- Tasks like demining or guarding installations may be more or less distant from active military operations based on the strategic context.

## Involvement of PMCs
- It is important to note that most private military companies are not exclusively involved in business overseas.
- PMCs can provide a range of services, including security, logistics, training, and advisory roles, both domestically and internationally.
- Their involvement in military operations depends on the specific contracts and agreements they have with their clients.

Note: The provided information is limited, and further details about the specific roles and responsibilities of PMCs in different contexts would be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding. 

# Private Military Companies (PMCs) and Private Security Companies (PSCs)

## Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) in the United States primarily provide a range of services for the US Government. These services include logistics, equipment specification and testing, training, and strategic advice. While PMCs may also operate abroad, their international activities are usually a small part of their overall business.

## Private Security Companies (PSCs)
Private Security Companies (PSCs) offer security services abroad for various clients, including companies, governments, and organizations like the United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In some countries, like Angola, foreign investors are required by the government to provide their own security, often by hiring a private company.

### Role of PSCs
The role of PSCs is similar to that of security companies in domestic contexts. They provide security guards and related services to ensure the safety and protection of their clients. In developed countries, the ratio of private security guards to police is estimated to be 3:1, while in less developed countries, it can be 10:1 or even higher.

### International Operations
When PSCs provide services overseas, they typically do so through a local subsidiary that operates under the laws and regulations of the host country. This allows them to comply with local requirements and ensure their operations are in line with local laws.

## Comparison between PMCs and PSCs
- PMCs primarily serve the US Government, while PSCs offer services to a variety of clients, including companies, governments, and organizations.
- PMCs focus on logistics, equipment testing, training, and strategic advice, while PSCs specialize in providing security services.
- PMCs' international operations are usually a small part of their business, while PSCs often operate extensively abroad.
- PSCs may be required by governments in some countries for foreign investors to provide their own security, while PMCs primarily serve the US Government's needs.

It is important to note that the information provided here is a summary of the main points about PMCs and PSCs. Further research and study may be required for a more comprehensive understanding of these topics. 

# Private Security Companies (PSCs) and Private Military Companies (PMCs)

Private Security Companies (PSCs) and Private Military Companies (PMCs) are organizations that provide security services and military-related activities. PSCs primarily focus on security services, while PMCs engage in a wider range of activities, including combat operations.

## PSCs and their activities
- PSCs offer security services, such as guarding and protecting individuals, buildings, or assets.
- Some PSCs operate in dangerous areas and employ armed guards who may be difficult to distinguish from soldiers.
- PSCs can also be involved in training local forces, negotiating with rebel groups, and using advanced intelligence equipment.
- An extreme example of the merging roles between PSCs and PMCs is the case of Gurkha Security Guards in Sierra Leone. Initially a security services company, they later accepted an invitation to train the Sierra Leone armed forces. During their work, some members of the team were ambushed by rebel forces, engaged in combat, and unfortunately lost their lives.

## PMCs and their activities
- PMCs engage in a wider range of activities compared to PSCs, including combat operations.
- They can provide military training, strategic advice, and logistical support to armed forces.
- PMCs may also participate in peacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief efforts.
- Some PMCs have been involved in controversial activities, such as providing security for fisheries or training for military operations.

It is important to note that the distinction between PSCs and PMCs can sometimes be blurred, as some PSCs may engage in activities that are traditionally associated with PMCs.

# Roles of PSCs and PMCs

## PSCs
- Provide security services, such as guarding and protecting individuals, buildings, or assets.
- Operate in both domestic and international markets.
- Some PSCs employ armed guards who may be difficult to distinguish from soldiers.
- Involved in training local forces, negotiating with rebel groups, and using advanced intelligence equipment.
- Example: Gurkha Security Guards in Sierra Leone, who initially provided security services but later trained the Sierra Leone armed forces and got involved in combat.

## PMCs
- Engage in a wider range of activities, including combat operations.
- Provide military training, strategic advice, and logistical support to armed forces.
- Participate in peacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief efforts.

- # Private Military Companies and Mercenary Activity

Private military companies (PMCs) and mercenaries are both involved in providing military services abroad. However, there is a lack of clear definitions for these terms, which makes it difficult to accurately assess the extent of their activities.

## Definitions and Challenges

- The internationally agreed definitions of PMCs and mercenaries have been shaped to suit the agendas of those drafting them, and may not be very useful.
- Different labels can be devised based on the activities, intentions, and effects of these operators.
- In practice, the categories of PMCs and mercenaries often merge into one another.
- If the government decides to regulate this activity, choosing the right definitions will be a significant challenge.

## Lack of Information

- Information about private military activity abroad is hard to obtain and often unreliable.
- Different sources may have different perspectives on the same activity.
- This lack of reliable information makes it challenging to accurately assess the extent of private military company and mercenary activity.

It is important to note that the provided information is limited and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of private military companies and mercenary activity. Further research and analysis are necessary to gain a more in-depth understanding of this topic. 

# Private Military Services

Private military services refer to the use of private individuals or companies to provide military or security-related services. These services can range from combat operations to logistical support and training. It is difficult to accurately estimate the extent and impact of private military services due to their secretive nature.

## Examples of Private Military Services

# Mercenary/PMC Interventions in Africa since the 1950s

- The scale of these interventions varies, with some involving only a few traditional mercenaries and others involving large groups or companies.
- The largest scale intervention by non-nationals is believed to be in Afghanistan, where forces fighting against the Russians and other Afghan groups included major foreign elements.
- Some estimate that more than half of the Taliban forces in Afghanistan were from outside the country.
- While many of these individuals may describe themselves as volunteers rather than mercenaries, financial rewards are likely an important factor.
- In some cases, the impact of foreign forces may be insignificant.
- Frederick Forsyth commented on the mercenaries involved in the Biafra conflict, stating that most of them were "little more than thugs in uniform."

# Examples of Mercenary/PMC Interventions in Africa since the 1950s

1. Biafra Conflict:
   - Mercenaries involved were described as "little more than thugs in uniform" by Frederick Forsyth.
   - Their impact on the conflict may have been minimal.

2. Afghanistan:
   - The largest scale intervention by non-nationals.
   - Forces fighting against the Russians and other Afghan groups included major foreign elements.
   - More than half of the Taliban forces were estimated to be from outside Afghanistan.
   - Financial rewards likely played a significant role in attracting these individuals.

Note: The provided information is limited, and further research may be required for a comprehensive understanding of mercenary/PMC interventions in Africa since the 1950s. 

# Mercenaries and their Role in Conflict

## Introduction
Mercenaries are individuals or groups of individuals who are hired to fight in a conflict on behalf of a party that is not their own. They are motivated by financial gain rather than loyalty to a particular cause or country.

## Impact of Mercenaries in Conflict
- Mercenaries can have a significant impact on the outcome of a conflict, especially when they possess specialized skills or have access to advanced equipment.
- In some cases, a small number of mercenaries can make a large difference in the outcome of a battle or war.
- Foreign mercenaries have been known to fly fighter-bombers for national air forces, providing critical capabilities to the government they are fighting for.
- Sierra Leone and Guinea have employed foreign mercenaries with specialist military skills to help restore security in the region.

## Role of Private Military Companies
- Private military companies (PMCs) play a significant role in the use of mercenaries in conflicts.
- PMCs are private companies that offer security services and military expertise to clients.
- Today's mercenaries are more likely to be recruited by PMCs rather than working independently.
- PMCs provide a more organized and structured approach to the use of mercenaries, making their operations more significant than those of individual mercenaries.

## Examples of Mercenaries in Conflict
- During the Biafra conflict, it was noted that the Nigerian officers had greater technical knowledge but no more courage or ferocity than the Biafran officers.
- Foreign mercenaries have been reported to fly Russian-built fighter-bombers for the Ethiopian Air Force, providing critical capabilities to the Ethiopian government.
- In Sierra Leone and Guinea, foreign mercenaries with specialized military skills have played a vital role in re-establishing security in the region.

## Conclusion
Mercenaries, often recruited by private military companies, can have a significant impact on the outcome of conflicts. Their specialized skills and access to advanced equipment make them valuable assets in battle. However, their motivations are primarily financial, and they do not have the same loyalty or commitment as regular military personnel.
