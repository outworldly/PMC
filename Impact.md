# Private Military and Security Companies

Private military and security companies (PMSCs) are private companies that provide military advice and assistance to participate in armed conflicts, both internal and international. They offer various services related to security and military operations. Here are some examples of PMSCs and their activities:

1. Executive Outcomes (disbanded in 1999)
   - Provided military assistance and training to governments and rebel groups.
   - Involved in conflicts in Angola and Sierra Leone.

2. Sandline International
   - Closely related to Executive Outcomes.
   - Engaged in military and security operations.

Please note that the list provided is not exhaustive and may not be up to date. There could be many more PMSCs active in Africa, Colombia, Indonesia, and other regions with risks of violence. The extractive industries, which operate in remote or dangerous areas, often rely on the services of PMSCs for security.

It is important to consider the countries of origin of these companies. The literature suggests that the United States and South Africa are significant contributors to the PMSC industry.

Overall, PMSCs play a role in providing military and security services to various clients, including governments, rebel groups, and private companies operating in high-risk areas. 

# Angola's Civil War and the Role of Executive Outcomes

## Background
- Angola experienced a civil war that lasted from 1975 to 2002.
- The war was fought between the Angolan government, led by the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), and the rebel group UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola).
- The conflict was fueled by political and ideological differences, as well as competition for control over Angola's rich natural resources, such as diamonds and oil.

## Executive Outcomes
- Executive Outcomes was a private military company (PMC) that operated during the 1990s.
- They were hired by the Angolan government to provide military support and training.
- Despite having a small number of personnel (never exceeding 500), Executive Outcomes played a significant role in the outcome of the war.

## Victories and Turning Point
- In 1994, with the assistance of Executive Outcomes, the Angolan government achieved a series of victories.
- One notable success was the recapture of the diamond fields in Lunda Note in June 1994.
- This victory is considered a turning point in the war, as it weakened UNITA's ability to finance its operations.

## Peace Agreement
- In November 1994, UNITA signed a peace agreement in Lusaka, Zambia.
- The agreement included a provision for the withdrawal of foreign forces, including Executive Outcomes.
- However, Executive Outcomes remained in Angola until December 1995, reportedly due to pressure from the United States.

## Role in Securing Victory
- Despite their small numbers compared to the Angolan armed forces, Executive Outcomes is widely recognized for their critical role in securing victory for the government forces.
- They played a significant part in achieving a ceasefire and the signing of the Lusaka Peace Agreement, although the stability of these agreements remains uncertain.

## Supply Side Factors
- Many observers attribute the growth of Executive Outcomes to the supply side factors of the conflict.
- These factors include the competition for control over Angola's valuable natural resources, such as diamonds and oil.
- The availability of resources allowed the Angolan government to hire and sustain the services of private military companies like Executive Outcomes.

# Private Military Companies (PMCs) and the Cold War

Private Military Companies (PMCs) emerged as a result of the Cold War and the reduction in the size of armed forces in the West and former Warsaw Pact countries. This created a pool of professional soldiers seeking employment opportunities. While it is difficult to determine the exact significance of this factor, it is evident that ex-servicemen from Central Europe and Ukraine have been operating as mercenaries in Africa. 

# Outsourcing Defense Functions
- The British Government has been outsourcing certain defense functions for a number of years.
- This includes a significant proportion of training for the Armed Forces.
- Up to 80% of army training now involves civilian contractors in some way.
- The Royal Navy also conducts most of its shore-based training in partnership with commercial contractors.

# Future of PMCs
- If the speculation is correct, companies like MPRI, DynCorp, and Pacific A&E will be prominent in the future.
- These companies will play a major role in providing military services and expertise.
- They may replace companies like Executive Outcomes in terms of prominence and market presence. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military services and expertise to governments and other clients. They can offer a range of services, including training, advisory, and combat support.

## Commercial Opportunities Abroad
- Companies that provide training or other services for the UK Armed Forces are increasingly seeking commercial opportunities abroad.
- This means that PMCs are expanding their operations beyond their home country and offering their services to foreign governments and clients.
- The demand for PMCs abroad is driven by countries that have legitimate needs but inadequate military capabilities.
- There is a growing number of weak governments that have to deal with internal instability and may turn to PMCs for advice, training, or even combat support.

## Changing Dynamics
- During the Cold War, governments could often rely on support from one side or the other. However, this is no longer the case.
- In the absence of intervention by the United Nations (UN) or regional organizations, governments may be tempted to seek assistance from PMCs.
- PMCs can provide advice and training to governments facing internal instability or other challenges.
- While PMCs may not directly engage in combat, they can play a role in supporting military operations.
