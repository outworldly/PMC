# Regulation of Security Actions

## Implications of Security Actions
Security actions in the field have implications beyond normal commercial transactions. They may involve the use of force and the taking of lives. They can also impact stability within a country or region, even if private military companies (PMCs) are not directly engaged in combat. For example, the training programs of MPR1 altered the balance of forces in the Balkans.

## Historical Context
The regulation of security actions has a historical background. Britain was one of the last European countries to abandon mercenary forces. These forces were hired for the Crimea but were not deployed in time. The regulation of security actions was further emphasized by the case of the Alabama, a warship fitted out in Britain for use by the Confederate Forces in the American Civil War.

## Potential Conflicts with Foreign Policy Objectives
Activity in the security field by individuals or companies could conflict with Britain's foreign policy objectives. British forces could find themselves confronting forces that had been assisted by a British company.

## Contingency
- British forces may have to confront forces that have been assisted by a British company.
- This situation could arise if individuals or companies in the security field act in a way that goes against Britain's foreign policy objectives. # The Impact of Consultancy and Training Abroad

Consultancy and training abroad can have a significant impact on various aspects. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Importance of Know-How**: In today's world, knowledge and expertise are just as important as physical resources. Consultancy and training abroad can provide valuable know-how to individuals and organizations.

- **Reputation**: The actions of British companies abroad can reflect on Britain's reputation. People may assume that if a British company is involved, it has some level of approval from the government. This perception can affect how British policy is perceived.

- **Risk of Misinterpretation**: There is always a risk of misinterpretation when British companies are involved in major operations abroad. This can lead to misunderstandings and potential negative consequences.

- **Safety Concerns**: A major operation abroad by a British Private Military Company (PMC) can put British lives at risk. In such cases, the British government may be obliged to intervene if the operation goes wrong.

# Regulation and its Benefits

Regulation in the consultancy and training industry can have several positive benefits. Here are some advantages:

- **Guidelines**: Regulation would establish guidelines for the industry, providing clear expectations from the government. This would help companies understand what is expected of them.

- **Industry Standards**: Regulation can help establish industry standards, ensuring that companies adhere to certain practices and ethics. This can enhance professionalism and credibility within the industry.

- **Accountability**: With regulation, companies would be held accountable for their actions. This can help prevent misconduct and ensure that companies operate responsibly.

- **Consumer Protection**: Regulation can also protect consumers by ensuring that companies provide quality services and meet certain standards. This can help build trust between clients and service providers.

- **Fair Competition**: Regulation can create a level playing field for all companies in the industry. This can prevent unfair practices and promote healthy competition.

- **Public Confidence**: Regulation can increase public confidence in the industry. Knowing that there are regulations in place can give individuals and organizations assurance that they are dealing with reputable and trustworthy service providers.

- **Industry Growth**: Regulation can contribute to the overall growth and development of the industry. By setting standards and promoting professionalism, it can attract more clients and investors.

It is important to note that these are potential benefits of regulation and not all regulations may have the same impact. The specific details and implementation of regulations can vary depending on the context and jurisdiction. # Private Military/Security Sector Regulation

## Benefits of Regulation
- Regulation can help establish a respectable private military/security sector.
- This can marginalize disreputable companies and individuals.
- A reputable private military sector can benefit international organizations, NGOs, and sovereign governments.

## Difficulties in Legislation/Regulation
1. Cost of regulation:
   - Burden on both government and private sector.
   - Covered in Annex C, which includes a regulatory impact assessment.
2. Effectiveness of legislation:
   - Activities for which regulation is being considered take place abroad.

Note: The effectiveness of legislation will be explored further below. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military services to governments, organizations, or individuals. They operate outside the normal scope of British law and are highly mobile.

## Challenges with Regulation
1. PMCs operate outside the normal scope of British law, making it difficult to regulate their activities.
2. PMCs are highly mobile and can easily move from one jurisdiction to another if they find the regulatory environment inconvenient.

## Potential Solutions
1. Implementing a regulatory system: Although not foolproof, a regulatory system could be effective if the sector as a whole believes it is in their interests. This would require the cooperation and compliance of PMCs.
2. Fair and reasonable regulatory regime: If the regulatory regime is viewed as fair and reasonable, PMCs that choose to go offshore and place themselves outside the system would be marginalized in the sector and their reputations would suffer.

## International Legal Framework
1. International regulatory regime: One solution to the challenge of mobile companies would be to establish an international regulatory regime. However, there has been limited progress in this area.

## International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries
- Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989
- Declares mercenary activity as an offense under the Convention
- Calls on states to take preventative measures against recruitment, financing, training, and use of mercenaries

## Definition of a Mercenary
- Follows the definition in the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions and the OAU Convention
- Definition not provided in these notes

## Implementation of the Convention
- Came into force on October 20, 2001
- Costa Rica became the 22nd state to deposit instruments of ratification or accession with the UN Secretary General
- Other 21 states that have already done this:
  - Azerbaijan
  - Barbados
  - Belarus
  - Cameroon
  - Croatia
  - Cyprus
  - Georgia
  - Italy
  - Libya
  - Maldives
  - Mauritania
  - Qatar
  - Saudi Arabia
  - Senegal
  - Seychelles
  - Suriname
  - Togo
  - Turkmenistan
  - Ukraine
  - Uruguay
  - Uzbekistan

## United Kingdom's Position
- No information provided in these notes # Regulation of Private Military Companies (PMCs) and Mercenaries

## Reasons for not becoming party to the Convention
- The government, like most other Western governments, has not become party to the Convention.
- The main reason is the belief that successful prosecution based on the definitions in the Convention would be extremely difficult.
- It is challenging to establish an individual's motivation beyond reasonable doubt.

## Legislative or regulatory provisions in foreign countries
- Annex B provides details of legislative or regulatory provisions on PMCs or mercenaries in several foreign countries.
- The two most interesting cases are the United States and South Africa, both of which have active PMC/PSC sectors.
- The United States operates a licensing system for PMCs.
- South Africa has passed new legislation, but it is not yet fully in force.

## Options for regulation on a national basis
- This section explores the main options for regulating PMCs and mercenaries on a national level.
- The options presented are not exhaustive but are meant to stimulate thought and debate. # Main Topic: Alternatives to Military Activity Abroad

## Option 1: Ban on Military Activity Abroad
- This could be achieved through an amendment of the 1870 Foreign Enlistment Act or by independent legislation.
- Arguments for:
  - Direct way of dealing with objectionable activity.
  - Can apply to all activities or limited range (e.g. direct participation in combat).
- Difficulties:
  - Enforcing the legislation would be challenging.
  - Gathering evidence for successful prosecution in British courts would be difficult.
  - Definitional problems may arise if the ban is not clearly defined.

## Option 2: Intermediate Alternatives
- There could be alternative measures or combinations of features from different options.
- These alternatives would provide a middle ground between the various options.
- Examples of intermediate alternatives are not provided.

Note: The provided information is limited and does not provide specific examples or details for intermediate alternatives. # International Humanitarian Law and Military Operations

## Introduction
International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is a set of rules that aim to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilities during armed conflicts. It applies to both international and non-international armed conflicts.

## Provision of Services to Combatants
- There is a debate about whether humanitarian organizations should provide services to combatants.
- If the ban on providing services is extended to combatants, it may make the activities of some humanitarian organizations illegal.
- It would be difficult to determine whether certain services, such as electricity or water, should be included in the ban.
- Some argue that a blanket ban would be an unwarranted interference with individual liberty.

## Support for Military Operations
- There is also a debate about whether humanitarian organizations should provide support to military operations.
- Some argue that support, such as training and strategic advice, may be vital to military operations.
- Others argue that a ban on support would deprive weak but legitimate governments of needed assistance.

## Impact on British Defence Exporters
- A ban on providing services to combatants or support to military operations could affect British defence exporters.
- Services are often a necessary part of export sales.
- A blanket ban could deprive British defence exporters of legitimate business opportunities.

## Conclusion
- The provision of services to combatants and support for military operations by humanitarian organizations is a complex issue.
- Balancing the need to protect individuals during armed conflicts with the potential impact on humanitarian organizations and defence exporters is challenging.
- It is important to consider the specific circumstances and context of each situation when discussing the role of humanitarian organizations in military operations. # Main Topic: Legislation against recruitment for service abroad

## Background
The Diplock Report, published in 1976, addressed the issue of British mercenaries being involved in Angola. It recommended legislation to target activities in the UK that recruit individuals for service abroad in specified armed forces. However, it did not suggest making the act of serving itself illegal. The report also proposed that this legislation should be in the form of an Enabling Act, which would empower the government to specify particular armed forces for which recruitment would be illegal.

## Arguments for Legislation
- Avoiding difficulties: Enacting legislation against activities that take place abroad can be challenging. The recommended legislation would focus on activities within the UK, making it easier to enforce.
- Government intervention: The legislation would allow the government to intervene only when there is evidence of recruitment for specific armed forces, rather than a blanket ban on all service abroad.
- Prosecution of recruiters: Those who publicize recruitment opportunities would be liable for prosecution, along with those directly involved in recruitment.

## Enabling Act
- The legislation proposed by the Diplock Report would be in the form of an Enabling Act.
- An Enabling Act empowers the government to specify particular armed forces for which recruitment would be illegal.
- This allows the government to adapt and update the legislation as needed, based on the changing circumstances and threats.

## Merits and Demerits
- The Diplock Report provides a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of legislation in this area.
- It is worth reading the report for a detailed understanding of the topic.

## Background
Private military companies (PMCs) are organizations that provide military and security services for hire. They are often employed by governments or other entities to carry out tasks that would traditionally be performed by military forces. However, the use of PMCs has raised concerns about accountability and the potential for abuse of power.

## Proposal 1: Code of Conduct
- A code of conduct would establish ethical guidelines for PMCs to follow.
- It would outline acceptable behavior and prohibit actions that violate human rights or international law.
- This would help ensure that PMCs operate in a responsible and respectable manner.

## Proposal 2: Licensing Regime
- Legislation would require PMCs to obtain a license for contracts for military and security services abroad.
- This would provide a regulatory framework for the industry and allow for greater oversight.
- Companies or individuals would need to meet certain criteria and adhere to specific standards in order to obtain a license.

## Proposal 3: Restrictions on Recruitment
- One proposal suggests restricting the recruitment of freelance mercenaries who are employed on a casual basis.
- This would aim to prevent the worst kind of interventions by the private military sector.
- However, it may not be effective for private military companies with permanent employees or those who transfer personnel between conflicts.

## Potential Challenges
- PMCs could potentially evade regulations by using offshore centers and advertising through the internet.
- The effectiveness of these proposals in creating a respectable and responsible industry is questionable.

These policy proposals aim to address the concerns surrounding private military companies. By implementing a code of conduct, establishing a licensing regime, and placing restrictions on recruitment, the government seeks to ensure that PMCs operate ethically and responsibly. However, challenges such as evading regulations and the effectiveness of these measures remain.
