The FMA Act was passed to address the issues of mercenaries and private military companies (PMCs) in South Africa. Before the FMA Act, only members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) were prohibited from engaging in mercenary activities.

The FMA Act prohibits any person, whether in South Africa or elsewhere, from recruiting, using, training, financing, or engaging in mercenary activity. Mercenary activity is defined as "direct participation as a combatant in armed conflict for private gain."

- The application of laws related to mercenaries depends on the existence of armed conflict.
- The recipient of the services provided by mercenaries must be a party to the conflict.
