# The Foreign Military Assistance (FMA) Act in South Africa

The FMA Act was passed to address the issues of mercenaries and private military companies (PMCs) in South Africa. Before the FMA Act, only members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) were prohibited from engaging in mercenary activities.

## Mercenary Activities

The FMA Act prohibits any person, whether in South Africa or elsewhere, from recruiting, using, training, financing, or engaging in mercenary activity. Mercenary activity is defined as "direct participation as a combatant in armed conflict for private gain."

## Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance

The FMA Act does not prohibit foreign military assistance but rather regulates it. Requests to supply foreign military assistance and all related arms materials are scrutinized by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC). The NCACC is chaired by a Minister from the government.

## Key Points:

- Mercenary activity is defined as direct participation in armed conflict for private gain.
- The FMA Act prohibits recruiting, using, training, financing, or engaging in mercenary activity.
- Foreign military assistance is regulated, not prohibited, by the FMA Act.

## Relationship between Mercenaries and the Defence Industry
- The defence industry does not have direct links with the recruitment or use of mercenaries.
- The application of laws related to mercenaries depends on the existence of armed conflict.
