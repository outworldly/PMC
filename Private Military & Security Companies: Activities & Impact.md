# Private Military and Security Companies

Private military and security companies (PMSCs) are private companies that provide military advice and assistance to participate in armed conflicts, both internal and international. They offer various services related to security and military operations. Here are some examples of PMSCs and their activities:

1. Executive Outcomes (disbanded in 1999)
   - Provided military assistance and training to governments and rebel groups.
   - Involved in conflicts in Angola and Sierra Leone.

2. Sandline International
   - Closely related to Executive Outcomes.
   - Engaged in military and security operations.

Please note that the list provided is not exhaustive and may not be up to date. There could be many more PMSCs active in Africa, Colombia, Indonesia, and other regions with risks of violence. The extractive industries, which operate in remote or dangerous areas, often rely on the services of PMSCs for security.

It is important to consider the countries of origin of these companies. The literature suggests that the United States and South Africa are significant contributors to the PMSC industry.

Overall, PMSCs play a role in providing military and security services to various clients, including governments, rebel groups, and private companies operating in high-risk areas. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
- PMCs are private companies that provide military services to governments, organizations, or individuals.
- Some prominent countries with PMCs include China (CA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Israel.
- The number of major combat operations undertaken by PMCs is limited, as is the number of companies willing to engage directly in combat and operational support.
- Analysts have focused on the activities of Executive Outcomes in Angola and Sierra Leone, but these were exceptional operations and it is uncertain if similar operations will be repeated.
- However, there are some indications that both the supply and demand for PMCs may grow.

## Executive Outcomes in Angola
- Mercenaries have played a part in the Angolan conflict on several occasions.
- British and American mercenaries fought for the FNLA in 1975/6.
- The MPLA had support from exiled Katangese gendarmes and later from Cuban forces.
- These Cuban forces were not considered mercenaries because they were paid by the Cuban Government.

# Key Points about PMCs
- PMCs are private companies that provide military services.
- The number of major combat operations undertaken by PMCs is limited.
- Executive Outcomes in Angola and Sierra Leone were exceptional operations.
- The supply and demand for PMCs may grow in the future.

## Background
- Angola is a country in southern Africa.
- Civil war broke out in Angola in 1975 after it gained independence from Portugal.
- Two main factions were involved in the war: MPLA (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola) and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola).
- MPLA was the ruling party and had support from the Soviet Union and Cuba.
- UNITA was a rebel group and had support from the United States and South Africa.

## Mercenaries and Elections
- UNITA hired a variety of mercenaries to support their cause.
- In 1992, elections were held in Angola under UN supervision and MPLA won.
- UNITA, having withdrawn its troops from the army, attempted a coup a month later, but it failed and the civil war resumed.

## Executive Outcomes
- In 1992, Sonangol, an Angolan parastatal company, hired Executive Outcomes to secure the Soyo oilfield and the computerized pumping station owned by Chevron, Petrangol, Texaco, and Elf-Fina-Gulf.
- Executive Outcomes, backed by two Angolan battalions, regained the oilfield in early 1993.
- Executive Outcomes then withdrew, leaving the Angolan battalions in place.
- However, UNITA later recaptured Soyo.

## Contract with Executive Outcomes
- In September of the same year, the Angolan government agreed to a more far-reaching contract with Executive Outcomes.
- The contract was reportedly worth $40 million and included training and directing operations against UNITA.
- Executive Outcomes also supplied arms to the Angolan government.

## Summary
- The civil war in Angola started in 1975 after gaining independence from Portugal.
- MPLA and UNITA were the main factions involved.
- UNITA hired mercenaries to support their cause.
- Elections were held in 1992, but UNITA attempted a coup a month later, leading to the resumption of the civil war.
- Executive Outcomes was hired to secure the Soyo oilfield, but UNITA later recaptured it.
- The Angolan government then signed a contract with Executive Outcomes for training and directing operations against UNITA. # Angola's Civil War and the Role of Executive Outcomes

## Background
- Angola experienced a civil war that lasted from 1975 to 2002.
- The war was fought between the Angolan government, led by the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), and the rebel group UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola).
- The conflict was fueled by political and ideological differences, as well as competition for control over Angola's rich natural resources, such as diamonds and oil.

## Executive Outcomes
- Executive Outcomes was a private military company (PMC) that operated during the 1990s.
- They were hired by the Angolan government to provide military support and training.
- Despite having a small number of personnel (never exceeding 500), Executive Outcomes played a significant role in the outcome of the war.

## Victories and Turning Point
- In 1994, with the assistance of Executive Outcomes, the Angolan government achieved a series of victories.
- One notable success was the recapture of the diamond fields in Lunda Note in June 1994.
- This victory is considered a turning point in the war, as it weakened UNITA's ability to finance its operations.

## Peace Agreement
- In November 1994, UNITA signed a peace agreement in Lusaka, Zambia.
- The agreement included a provision for the withdrawal of foreign forces, including Executive Outcomes.
- However, Executive Outcomes remained in Angola until December 1995, reportedly due to pressure from the United States.

## Role in Securing Victory
- Despite their small numbers compared to the Angolan armed forces, Executive Outcomes is widely recognized for their critical role in securing victory for the government forces.
- They played a significant part in achieving a ceasefire and the signing of the Lusaka Peace Agreement, although the stability of these agreements remains uncertain.

## Supply Side Factors
- Many observers attribute the growth of Executive Outcomes to the supply side factors of the conflict.
- These factors include the competition for control over Angola's valuable natural resources, such as diamonds and oil.
- The availability of resources allowed the Angolan government to hire and sustain the services of private military companies like Executive Outcomes.

Overall, Executive Outcomes played a crucial role in the Angolan Civil War, assisting the government forces in achieving significant victories and ultimately contributing to the signing of a peace agreement. Despite their small numbers, their involvement had a significant # Private Military Companies (PMCs) and the Cold War

Private Military Companies (PMCs) emerged as a result of the Cold War and the reduction in the size of armed forces in the West and former Warsaw Pact countries. This created a pool of professional soldiers seeking employment opportunities. While it is difficult to determine the exact significance of this factor, it is evident that ex-servicemen from Central Europe and Ukraine have been operating as mercenaries in Africa. 

## Western Phenomenon

PMCs are primarily a Western phenomenon, established by former professional servicemen from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Israel, and Southern Africa. The end of the Cold War may not have directly influenced the rise of PMCs, but it is clear that the change of regime in South Africa and the subsequent restructuring of the armed forces played a crucial role in the formation of Executive Outcomes, a notable PMC.

## Executive Outcomes

Executive Outcomes is an example of a PMC that emerged as a result of the change of regime in South Africa and the subsequent restructuring of the armed forces. It is important to note that Executive Outcomes may be considered a one-off phenomenon, and therefore, the literature on PMCs may overemphasize its successes.

In summary, the emergence of PMCs can be attributed to the reduction in the size of armed forces during the Cold War, which created a pool of professional soldiers seeking employment. PMCs are primarily a Western phenomenon, established by former professional servicemen from the US, UK, France, Israel, and Southern Africa. The change of regime in South Africa and the subsequent restructuring of the armed forces played a significant role in the formation of Executive Outcomes, a notable PMC. However, it is uncertain whether the end of the Cold War directly influenced the rise of PMCs. # Private Military Companies (PMCs) in South Africa

Private military companies (PMCs) in South Africa were able to establish themselves relatively easily due to several factors. These PMCs had a common language, shared training in counterinsurgency, and a collective experience in combat. Being African-based, they possessed invaluable local knowledge, particularly in the case of Angola.

However, there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of these forces. Private companies typically lack the financial resources to maintain the same level of training and readiness as professional national military establishments. Assembling a force quickly from diverse elements is likely to result in lower effectiveness compared to established PMCs like Executive Outcomes.

If these factors were the only driving forces behind the growth of PMCs, it could be argued that they may be a passing phenomenon. The end of the Cold War and the change of regime in South Africa were unique events that may not be repeated.

## Factors contributing to the growth of PMCs in South Africa

- Common language, training, and combat experience among PMC members
- African-based PMCs had valuable local knowledge, especially in Angola
- Concerns about the long-term sustainability of PMCs due to financial limitations
- Assembling a force quickly from diverse elements may result in lower effectiveness
- The growth of PMCs may be influenced by unique events such as the end of the Cold War and the change of regime in South Africa

It is important to note that these are just the student's notes and may not cover all aspects of the topic. Further research and study are recommended for a comprehensive understanding of PMCs in South Africa. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
- PMCs are private companies that provide military services and expertise.
- They are hired by governments and other organizations to perform functions previously done by the military.
- The number of PMCs is likely to grow as governments outsource more military functions.
- Major American military corporations like MPRI and Pacific A&E have been developed to meet this demand.
- Europe is also seeing a similar trend in the development of PMCs.
- This may create a supply of expertise in the private sector that could be available for foreign markets.

# Outsourcing Defense Functions
- The British Government has been outsourcing certain defense functions for a number of years.
- This includes a significant proportion of training for the Armed Forces.
- Up to 80% of army training now involves civilian contractors in some way.
- The Royal Navy also conducts most of its shore-based training in partnership with commercial contractors.

# Future of PMCs
- If the speculation is correct, companies like MPRI, DynCorp, and Pacific A&E will be prominent in the future.
- These companies will play a major role in providing military services and expertise.
- They may replace companies like Executive Outcomes in terms of prominence and market presence. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military services and expertise to governments and other clients. They can offer a range of services, including training, advisory, and combat support.

## Role of PMCs
- PMCs often employ specialist instructors, such as ex-military personnel, who provide training to military forces.
- They also offer facility management services, which involve managing and maintaining military facilities.
- PMCs can provide training packages to meet government-to-government requests, meaning they can assist in training the military forces of other countries.

## Commercial Opportunities Abroad
- Companies that provide training or other services for the UK Armed Forces are increasingly seeking commercial opportunities abroad.
- This means that PMCs are expanding their operations beyond their home country and offering their services to foreign governments and clients.
- The demand for PMCs abroad is driven by countries that have legitimate needs but inadequate military capabilities.
- There is a growing number of weak governments that have to deal with internal instability and may turn to PMCs for advice, training, or even combat support.

## Changing Dynamics
- During the Cold War, governments could often rely on support from one side or the other. However, this is no longer the case.
- In the absence of intervention by the United Nations (UN) or regional organizations, governments may be tempted to seek assistance from PMCs.
- PMCs can provide advice and training to governments facing internal instability or other challenges.
- While PMCs may not directly engage in combat, they can play a role in supporting military operations.

It is important to note that these notes are based on the provided information and do not include any additional information. # Private Military Companies

- PMCs may work for both the private sector and governments.
- The focus of PMCs is expected to be on non-combat tasks, with combat operations being a rarity. # Mercenaries and Private Military Companies

## Introduction
- Mercenaries have a bad reputation and are often seen as a form of abuse.
- In the 60s and 70s, mercenaries were associated with instability, secessionist movements, attempted coups, and human rights abuses.
- In recent years, there has been a renewed debate on the usefulness and dangers of private military companies.
- Some see private military companies as a new development, while others view them as a continuation of mercenarism.

## Accountability
- Some commentators highlight the lack of clear lines of accountability in private military companies.
- It is argued that mercenaries operate outside the legal framework and are not subject to the same regulations as regular military forces.
- This lack of accountability can lead to human rights abuses and other unethical behavior.

## Regulation
- There is a need for stricter regulation of private military companies to ensure accountability and prevent abuses.
- Some argue that international laws should be established to govern the activities of private military companies.
- Others believe that existing laws and regulations are sufficient and that better enforcement is needed.
