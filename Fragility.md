# Stability and Coercive Security

Stability and coercive security are often fragile and do not address the fundamental political and socio-economic issues that caused the conflict. It is true that military bodies like EO (Executive Outcomes) are hired for military tasks and should not be criticized for failing to address underlying socio-economic problems. Their main function is to create an environment where it becomes possible to tackle those problems. However, an over-reliance on coercive means of achieving security, whether public or private, will rarely provide long-term solutions. The easy availability of such means through private companies might tempt states to avoid the more difficult long-term challenges of creating inclusive and pluralistic politics.

- Stability and coercive security are often fragile and do not address the root causes of conflicts.
- Military bodies like EO are hired for military tasks and are not expected to solve underlying socio-economic problems.
- The function of military and security organizations is to create an environment where it becomes possible to tackle those problems.
- Over-reliance on coercive means of achieving security, whether public or private, is not a long-term solution.
- The easy availability of private military companies might tempt states to avoid the more difficult challenges of creating inclusive and pluralistic politics.

# Criticisms of EO and PMCs

While it is not fair to criticize EO or private military companies (PMCs) for not addressing underlying socio-economic problems, there are valid criticisms of an over-reliance on coercive means of achieving security.

- EO and PMCs are hired for military tasks, not for solving socio-economic problems.
- The function of military and security organizations is to create an environment where it becomes possible to tackle those problems.
- Criticisms of EO or PMCs should focus on the over-reliance on coercive means of achieving security.
- Over-reliance on coercive means rarely provides long-term solutions.
- The availability of private military companies might tempt states to avoid the more difficult challenges of creating inclusive and pluralistic politics.

# Long-Term Solutions for Security

To achieve long-term security, it is important to go beyond coercive means and address the underlying political and socio-economic issues.

- Coercive means of achieving security are not sufficient for long-term solutions.
- Addressing the underlying political and socio-economic issues is crucial for long-term security.
- Creating inclusive and pluralistic politics is a difficult but necessary challenge.
- Long-term security requires tackling the root causes of conflicts.
- Over-re # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military services to governments, organizations, or individuals. They are often hired to perform tasks that were traditionally carried out by the military, such as security, training, and logistics support.

## Impact on Stability
The employment of PMCs can have an impact on stability in the areas where they operate. Some factors to consider include:

- Resentment by the regular military: The presence of PMCs may be resented by the regular military forces, as they may see it as a threat to their authority or as undermining their role.
- Tension between government and military: In some cases, the employment of PMCs has led to tension between the government and the military. For example, Sandline's aborted contract with the government of Papua New Guinea resulted in tension between the government and the army.
- Influence on coups or political changes: There have been instances where the presence of PMCs has been associated with coups or political changes. For example, some observers link the coup in Sierra Leone that replaced Captain Strasser with the presence of Executive Outcomes (EO) and their training programs.

## Proxies for Governments
There is often an accusation that PMCs act as proxies for governments. While this is true in some cases, it is not always the case. Some points to consider include:

- MPRI as an instrument of US policy: MPRI, a PMC, has been accused of functioning as an instrument of US policy in the Balkans. The fact that MPRI's actions align with US Government policy is evident from the State Department's issuance of licenses.
- Assumptions without evidence: Many commentators assume a link between governments and PMCs or mercenaries, often without substantial evidence. Even when governments deny any covert link, commentators may still assume its existence.

It is important to note that these are general observations and may not apply to all PMCs or situations. The role and impact of PMCs can vary depending on the specific context and circumstances. # Private Military Companies (PMCs)
Private Military Companies (PMCs) are organizations that provide military services to governments and other clients. They often employ former members of the armed services, which can lead to conspiracy theories.

## Transparency and Regulation
- PMCs with transparent links to governments are less likely to be misinterpreted.
- Some argue for a licensing or regulatory system to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Moral Objections
- Modern society values a repugnance towards killing for money, even if it is necessary and done in a just cause.
- The idea of professional military competence without a primary loyalty to the community makes people uneasy.
- Encouraging such activity goes against our values and the way society is ordered.
- In a democracy, it is natural for the state to be defended by its own citizens.

Private Military Companies (PMCs) are private organizations that provide military services for a fee. They are often hired by governments or other entities to carry out military operations or provide security services. However, the use of PMCs is a controversial topic, with arguments both for and against their existence.

## Arguments in favor of PMCs

- **Re-establishing monopoly on violence**: In situations where a state is under threat from armed insurgents or criminal gangs with military capabilities, using a PMC may be the only realistic option to quickly re-establish the state's control and monopoly on violence. This can be more cost-effective and efficient than training national forces, which may also pose a risk of coup d'etat.

## Arguments against PMCs

- **Unattractive characters**: The involvement of PMCs in fighting for money often attracts individuals with questionable backgrounds and motives. This can lead to unethical behavior and human rights abuses.

- **Double standards**: The debate on PMCs sometimes assumes that national armies are inherently good while PMCs are inherently bad. However, national armies are also guilty of the same abuses that PMCs are accused of. They can be unaccountable and pose a danger to stability.

- **Lack of accountability**: PMCs operate outside the traditional military chain of command and are not subject to the same level of oversight and accountability as national armies. This can lead to a lack of transparency and difficulty in holding individuals or organizations accountable for their actions.

- **Threat to sovereignty**: The use of PMCs can raise concerns about the erosion of state sovereignty. When a state relies heavily on PMCs for its military operations, it may become dependent on external actors and lose control over its own security.

- **Profit-driven motives**: PMCs are profit-driven organizations, which can create conflicts of interest. Their primary goal is to make money, which may lead to decisions that prioritize financial gain over ethical considerations or the best interests of the state or the people they are hired to protect.

- **Lack of international regulation**: There is currently a lack of comprehensive international regulation governing the activities of PMCs. This can make it difficult to hold them accountable for any wrongdoing and ensure that they adhere to ethical standards.

- **Negative perception**: The use of PMCs can create a negative perception of the state or entity that hires them. It can be seen as a sign of weakness or an inability to handle security issues internally, which can damage reputation and relationships with other # Human Rights Violations and Private Military Companies (PMCs)
## Violations by National Armies
- In Sierra Leone, the national army was undisciplined, violent, and posed a threat to the civilian population.
- Some Nigerian forces operating under ECOMOG have also been accused of similar behavior.
- However, there have been no suggestions of such violations in the record of Executive Outcome, a PMC.

## State Authority and Non-State Violence
- In certain cases, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the late 1990s, state authority has declined to the point where it becomes difficult to distinguish between state and non-state violence.

## PMCs in International Operations
- People with experience in humanitarian operations or UN work, like Shearer, are more open to considering a role for PMCs.
- The UN and other international organizations often employ PMCs or Private Security Companies (PSCs) for logistics or security support.
- For example, UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone has received logistics support from Pacific A&E, and DSL has provided security services for various international operations.

# The Role of PMCs in International Operations
## Logistics Support
- PMCs and PSCs are frequently employed by the UN and other international organizations to provide logistics support.
- This can include transportation, supply chain management, and other related services.

## Security Services
- PMCs and PSCs also play a role in providing security services for international operations.
- This can involve protecting personnel, facilities, and assets in potentially dangerous environments.

## Ancillary Role
- PMCs and PSCs typically serve in an ancillary role, supporting the main operations of international organizations.
- They are not the primary actors but provide specialized services to enhance the effectiveness and safety of the mission.

## Examples
- Pacific A&E has provided logistics support to UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone.
- DSL has offered security services for a wide range of international operations.

# Conclusion
- Human rights violations by national armies have been observed in some cases, but there is no evidence of such violations in the record of Executive Outcome, a PMC.
- PMCs and PSCs are often employed by the UN and other international organizations for logistics and security support in international operations.
- They play an ancillary role, providing specialized services to enhance the effectiveness and safety of the mission. # Private Military Companies and the United Nations

Private military companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military services to governments, international organizations, and other clients. They are often hired to perform security and military tasks that traditional armed forces may not be able or willing to undertake. The United Nations (UN) is one organization that has considered employing PMCs for certain roles.

## Pros and Cons of Employing PMCs

### Pros
- PMCs can provide specialized skills and expertise that may be lacking in traditional armed forces.
- They can operate in areas where foreign industry and NGOs may be unwilling to operate without protection.
- PMCs can offer a level of confidence to foreign companies and organizations, which may encourage their involvement in certain regions.

### Cons
- The use of PMCs in wider roles for the UN is a topic that requires careful consideration and debate.
- Privatizing peace may not be widely accepted or supported by the international community.
- Some countries contribute to UN peacekeeping missions primarily for financial reasons, resulting in the deployment of poorly equipped and low-quality forces.

## The UN's Perspective

The Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, has acknowledged the potential use of PMCs in certain situations. He mentioned considering the possibility of engaging a private firm when skilled soldiers were needed to separate fighters from refugees in Rwandan refugee camps. However, he also recognized that the world may not be ready to privatize peace.

## Conclusion

While the idea of employing PMCs in wider roles for the UN may be controversial, it is worth examining this option. The UN already relies on contributions from countries that may have financial motivations for participating in peacekeeping missions. Exploring the use of PMCs could potentially address some of the challenges faced by the UN in maintaining peace and security in various regions of the world. However, it is important to carefully consider the implications and potential consequences of such a decision. # Private Companies in Peacekeeping Operations

Private companies have the potential to play a role in peacekeeping operations for the United Nations (UN). Currently, the UN faces challenges in recruiting forces for these operations. However, holding providing states accountable can be difficult due to the UN's status as a sovereign state. By involving private companies, the UN could potentially enforce higher standards on behavior, human rights, and efficiency in carrying out tasks.

## Benefits of Involving Private Companies

1. **Higher Standards**: Private companies could be held to higher standards compared to providing states. This would include not only efficiency in carrying out tasks but also adherence to behavior and human rights standards.

2. **Cost-effectiveness**: Involving private companies in peacekeeping operations could potentially be cheaper than current methods. For example, the UNAMSIL operation in Sierra Leone costs approximately $600 million per year. By putting the tasks of UNAMSIL out to tender, private companies may be able to perform the job more cheaply and effectively.

3. **Quicker Availability**: Private companies may be able to provide forces more quickly to the UN compared to traditional methods. This could enhance the UN's ability to respond promptly to peacekeeping needs.

4. **Willingness to Participate**: Private companies may be more willing to participate in peacekeeping operations compared to providing states. This could increase the pool of available forces for the UN.

## Example: United States' Use of Private Companies

The United States has already utilized private companies in peacekeeping operations. DynCorp and subsequently Pacific A&E were employed by the US to recruit and manage monitors in the Balkans. This example demonstrates that private companies can be successfully involved in peacekeeping efforts.

In conclusion, involving private companies in UN peacekeeping operations could bring several benefits. These include higher standards, cost-effectiveness, quicker availability of forces, and increased willingness to participate. The United States' use of private companies in the Balkans serves as an example of how this approach can be effective. # Mercenary Forces and Government Contractors

## Introduction
- Mercenary forces are hired soldiers who work for a profit.
- Governments have sometimes acted as contractors for mercenary forces.
- This practice was seen in the Swiss Cantons and some German principalities.

## Government Contractors vs. Mercenary Forces
- Governments acting as contractors for mercenary forces is different from the traditional definition of mercenaries.
- The Geneva definition excludes governments from being considered mercenaries.
- Governments hiring mercenary forces as contractors is a way of supporting their national forces in peacetime.

## Benefits of Contracting to the UN or Other International Bodies
- If a sovereign government contracts a private military company (PMC) to the UN or another international or regional body, many problems associated with employing mercenaries can be avoided.
- It would not be a threat to sovereignty or stability.
- The question of exploitation of raw material resources would not arise.
- Monitoring the performance and behavior of a PMC employed by the UN would not be difficult.

## Lack of Political Support
- Despite the potential benefits, there is currently not much political support for the idea of governments contracting PMCs to the UN or other international bodies.

## Scope for Government Action
- While governments have expressed disapproval of mercenaries, there is no effective legislation in place to address their activities. # Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870
The Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 is a law in the United Kingdom that prohibits British subjects from enlisting in the armed forces of a foreign state that is at war with another foreign state at peace with the UK. It also prohibits recruiting individuals for such service within the UK. However, there have been no prosecutions under this act related to enlistment or recruitment. The Director of Public Prosecutions considered prosecuting individuals for enlisting in the Spanish Civil War but abandoned the idea due to the difficulty of gathering evidence for activities taking place abroad. It is also uncertain whether the act would cover internal conflicts, such as those in Africa today. The Diplock Committee, after examining the issue, concluded that the act is ineffective and should be repealed or replaced.

- The Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 prohibits British subjects from enlisting in the armed forces of a foreign state at war with another foreign state at peace with the UK.
- It also prohibits recruiting individuals for such service within the UK.
- No prosecutions have been made under this act for enlistment or recruitment.
- The Director of Public Prosecutions considered prosecuting individuals for enlisting in the Spanish Civil War but faced difficulties in gathering evidence for activities taking place abroad.
- It is uncertain whether the act would cover internal conflicts, such as those in Africa today.
- The Diplock Committee concluded that the act is ineffective and should be repealed or replaced.

Note: The original text contains some spelling errors, which have been corrected in the notes. # The 1870 Act and the Paradox
The 1870 Act is a law that is paradoxical because if every country were to adopt a similar law, it would make the recruiting activities of the British Government in Nepal and other countries illegal.

# The Case for Regulation
There are several reasons for considering action to regulate activity by PMCs (Private Military Companies), PSCs (Private Security Companies), or mercenaries.

## General Considerations
- Bringing non-state violence under control has been an achievement of the last two centuries.
- Allowing non-state violence to become a major feature of the international scene again would have profound consequences.
- While it is unlikely to return to the circumstances of the 17th and 18th centuries when privateers were hard to distinguish from pirates and corporations commanded armies that could threaten states, it is important to learn from the past.
- If private force were to become widespread, there would be risks of misunderstanding, exploitation, and conflict.

## Bringing PMCs and PSCs within a Framework
- It may be safer to bring PMCs and PSCs within a framework of regulation.
- This would help to prevent the risks associated with widespread private force.
- Regulation can help ensure that PMCs and PSCs operate within legal and ethical boundaries.
- It can also help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts between different actors in the international scene.

## Benefits of Regulation
- Regulation can provide accountability for the actions of PMCs and PSCs.
- It can ensure that these companies adhere to international human rights standards.
- Regulation can also help prevent the misuse of private force for personal gain or political purposes.
- By regulating PMCs and PSCs, governments can maintain control over the use of force and prevent it from becoming a tool of private interests.

## International Cooperation
- Regulation of PMCs and PSCs would require international cooperation.
- Countries would need to work together to establish common standards and mechanisms for oversight.
- This would help prevent the exploitation of regulatory loopholes and ensure a level playing field for all actors involved.

## Conclusion
- The regulation of PMCs, PSCs, and mercenaries is important to prevent the risks associated with widespread private force.
- It can provide accountability, ensure adherence to human rights standards, and prevent the misuse of force.
- International cooperation is necessary to establish common standards and mechanisms for oversight.
